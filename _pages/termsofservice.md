# Terms of Service
Please read these Terms of Use, including those set forth in the Privacy Policy ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the Lemon Schedules application (the "App") made available by Blue Mountain Studios, LLC ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the App is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the App.

The App is not intended for and is not designed to attract children under 13 years of age. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE APP YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DISAGREE WITH ANY PART OF THE TERMS THEN YOU DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO ACCESS THE APP.

You cannot accept these Terms if: (i) you are not lawfully entitled to use the App under any applicable laws in the country in which you are located or resident; or (ii) if you are not of legal age to form a binding agreement with Administration. By accepting these terms you acknowledge and agree that you have reached the age to enter into such binding agreement in the country in which you are located or resident or that you have your parent or legal guardian’s permission if required by applicable law. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally allowed to enter into this Agreement and that you do not violate any applicable laws.

Blue Mountain Studios, LLC and third party providers may make improvements and/or changes in the capabilities, features, prices, and availability of the App at any time without notice. You agree that we shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the App or any portion thereof.

## Subscription Payments, Renewals, and Cancellation
Some parts of the App are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). If you choose to purchase a Subscription, payment will be charged to your Apple ID on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a weekly, monthly, or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

Your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless it is canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current Billing Cycle. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current Billing Cycle. You may manage or cancel your Subscription by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.

We do not send invoices to customers that purchase a Subscription. Your account balance information can be accessed by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.

### Fee Changes
We may, at any time and in our sole discretion, modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions.

### Trial Subscriptions
The App may offer a free trial subscription period during which you can use all features of the App for a limited period of time. If you fail to cancel your free trial subscription, you agree to be billed according to the terms set forth in the section of these terms entitled "Subscription Payments, Renewals, and Cancellation".

### Refunds and Billing Disputes
All purchases are final. We cannot issue refunds for purchases charged to your Apple ID. If you have a billing dispute, you must contact the App Store to seek a remedy.
