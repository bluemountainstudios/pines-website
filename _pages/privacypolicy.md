# Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on this website (the "Website") and the Pines app published by Blue Mountain Studios, LLC (the "App(s)").

Pines takes personal privacy seriously. We limit the collection of personal information to cases where we truly need it or is required for the operation of our products. Personal information is never shared except to comply by the law, develop and improve our products, or protect our rights.

## Information We Collect
### Debugging Data
We use both Sentry and Apple's opt-in crash reporting service to improve the quality of Pines. Your device type, OS version, and time of the crash will be viewable by us. No personally identifiable information is uploaded during this process.

Sentry's privacy policy can be found [here](https://sentry.io/privacy/).

When you access the App, we may collect certain information automatically, including, but not limited to, the type of device you use, the IP address of your device, your operating system, and other statistics.

### Randomly Generated Identifiers
We employ randomly generated identifiers to anonymously identify users. These IDs are linked to data transmitted to RevenueCat, Sentry, Mixpanel, and other third party services and are included in any log files you share with us. Although the ID may be associated with your device and/or Apple ID, we are unable to trace or connect it back to you unless you voluntarily provide us with the ID.

### User Identifiers
If you sign in to the App with Sign In with Apple, Apple will generate an identifier that we use to recognize you in the app. These IDs are linked to data transmitted to RevenueCat, Sentry, Mixpanel, and other third party services and are included in any log files you share with us. Although the ID may be associated with your device and/or Apple ID, we are unable to trace or connect it back to you personally unless you voluntarily provide us your ID.

### Purchase Data
We use Apple as a payment provider for paid subscriptions. Apple's Privacy Policy can be found [here](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/).

We use RevenueCat to manage trial and subscriptions purchases of Pines Pro. To manage these transactions, we send RevenueCat your anonymous user ID, user ID (if applicable), and the details of which item you are purchasing. Since Apple processes the transactions, no credit card or personally identifiable information is ever sent to RevenueCat. You may view RevenueCat's privacy policy [here](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/).

### Application Logs & Diagnostics
To assist us in diagnosing issues with the App, you may optionally send Application Logs & Diagnostics from the App. Doing so will send technical log information to the recipient of the diagnostics email. These logs may contain details about your device and interactions with the App, but they do not contain personally identifiable information.

### Analytics Data
To improve the quality of the App, we use Mixpanel to collect anonymous usage data from your use of the app. Your device type, OS version, IP address, user IDs, and other metadata along with usage information are sent to Mixpanel. If you wish to opt out of this form of analytics tracking, you may do so in the App's settings page under "Analytics".

Mixpanel's privacy policy can be found [here](https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/).

## Information Usage
We use the information we collect to operate and improve the Website, the App, and customer support. We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property. In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.

## Compliance

### HIPAA
The App does not collect health information from users. We are not a HIPAA covered entity nor a business associate by definition of Pub.L. 104-191. Should the user be a HIPAA covered entity or business associate or act within the bounds of a HIPAA covered entity's rule, it is within their discretion to use the App and we accept none of the liability for any potential physical or electronic security threats or breaches. For further information regarding protection of PHI and Pub.L. 104-191 also known as HIPAA, please visit HHS.gov and review your covered entity's HIPAA compliance policies as well as your state's HIPAA compliance policies.

### Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act
We never collect or maintain information at the Website or through the App from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of the Website or the App is structured to attract anyone under 13.

### California Online Privacy Protection Act
We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

### Information for European Union Customers
By using our services and providing your information, you authorize us and our partners to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.

### International Transfers of Information
Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is processed, stored, or used.

## Your Consent
By using the Website or the App, you consent to this privacy policy.
